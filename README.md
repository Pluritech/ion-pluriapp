This is a starter template for Pluritech apps

## Whats difference from original starter?

This template implements environment variables like @angular/cli does. To create an environment, just create a file enviroments/enviroment.newenv.ts and to run it, just execute:

```bash
$ PLURI_ENV=newenv ionic serve|build|cordova
```

## How to use this template

You just need to clone it and run: 
```bash
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
